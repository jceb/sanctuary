//# pipe :: Foldable f => f (Any -> Any) -> a -> b
//.
//. Takes a sequence of functions assumed to be unary and a value of any
//. type, and returns the result of applying the sequence of transformations
//. to the initial value.
//.
//. In general terms, `pipe` performs left-to-right composition of a sequence
//. of functions. `pipe ([f, g, h]) (x)` is equivalent to `h (g (f (x)))`.
//.
//. ```javascript
//. > S.pipe ([S.add (1), Math.sqrt, S.sub (1)]) (99)
//. 9
//. ```
