//# fromMaybe_ :: (() -> a) -> Maybe a -> a
//.
//. Variant of [`fromMaybe`](#fromMaybe) that takes a thunk so the default
//. value is only computed if required.

//. ```javascript
//. > function fib(n) { return n <= 1 ? n : fib (n - 2) + fib (n - 1); }
//.
//. > S.fromMaybe_ (() => fib (30)) (S.Just (1000000))
//. 1000000
//.
//. > S.fromMaybe_ (() => fib (30)) (S.Nothing)
