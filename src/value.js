//# value :: String -> StrMap a -> Maybe a
//.
//. Retrieve the value associated with the given key in the given string map.
//.
//. Formally, `value (k) (m)` evaluates to `Just (m[k])` if `k` is an
//. enumerable own property of `m`; `Nothing` otherwise.
//.
//. See also [`prop`](#prop) and [`get`](#get).
//.
//. ```javascript
//. > S.value ('foo') ({foo: 1, bar: 2})
//. Just (1)
//.
//. > S.value ('bar') ({foo: 1, bar: 2})
//. Just (2)
//.
//. > S.value ('baz') ({foo: 1, bar: 2})
//. Nothing
//. ```
