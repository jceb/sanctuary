//# mapMaybe :: (Filterable f, Functor f) => (a -> Maybe b) -> f a -> f b
//.
//. Takes a function and a structure, applies the function to each element
//. of the structure, and returns the "successful" results. If the result of
//. applying the function to an element is Nothing, the result is discarded;
//. if the result is a Just, the Just's value is included.
//.
//. ```javascript
//. > S.mapMaybe (S.head) ([[], [1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5, 6], []])
//. [1, 4]
//.
//. > S.mapMaybe (S.head) ({x: [1, 2, 3], y: [], z: [4, 5, 6]})
//. {x: 1, z: 4}
