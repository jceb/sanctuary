//# findMap :: Foldable f => (a -> Maybe b) -> f a -> Maybe b
//.
//. Finds the leftmost element of the given structure for which the given
//. function returns a Just, and returns that Just (or Nothing if none of
//. the elements matches).
//.
//. More flexible than [`find`](#find), and more convenient in situations
//. in which the result of a successful computation can be reused.
//.
//. ```javascript
//. > S.findMap (S.parseInt (16)) ([])
//. Nothing
//.
//. > S.findMap (S.parseInt (16)) (['X', 'Y', 'Z'])
//. Nothing
//.
//. > S.findMap (S.parseInt (16)) (['A', 'B', 'C'])
//. Just (10)
//. ```
