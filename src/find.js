//# find :: Foldable f => (a -> Boolean) -> f a -> Maybe a
//.
//. Takes a predicate and a structure and returns Just the leftmost element
//. of the structure that satisfies the predicate; Nothing if there is no
//. such element.
//.
//. See also [`findMap`](#findMap) and [`elem`](#elem).
//.
//. ```javascript
//. > S.find (S.lt (0)) ([1, -2, 3, -4, 5])
//. Just (-2)
//.
//. > S.find (S.lt (0)) ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
//. Nothing
