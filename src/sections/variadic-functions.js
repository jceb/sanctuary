//. Ramda provides several functions that take any number of arguments. These
//. are known as [variadic functions][]. Additionally, Ramda provides several
//. functions that take variadic functions as arguments. Although natural in
//. a dynamically typed language, variadic functions are at odds with the type
//. notation Ramda and Sanctuary both use, leading to some indecipherable type
//. signatures such as this one:
//.
//.     R.lift :: (*... -> *...) -> ([*]... -> [*])
//.
//. Sanctuary has no variadic functions, nor any functions that take variadic
//. functions as arguments. Sanctuary provides two "lift" functions, each with
//. a helpful type signature:
//.
//.     S.lift2 :: Apply f => (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
//.     S.lift3 :: Apply f => (a -> b -> c -> d) -> f a -> f b -> f c -> f d
