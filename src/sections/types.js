//.
//. Sanctuary uses Haskell-like type signatures to describe the types of
//. values, including functions. `'foo'`, for example, is a member of `String`;
//. `[1, 2, 3]` is a member of `Array Number`. The double colon (`::`) is used
//. to mean "is a member of", so one could write:
//.
//.     'foo' :: String
//.     [1, 2, 3] :: Array Number
//.
//. An identifier may appear to the left of the double colon:
//.
//.     Math.PI :: Number
//.
//. The arrow (`->`) is used to express a function's type:
//.
//.     Math.abs :: Number -> Number
//.
//. That states that `Math.abs` is a unary function that takes an argument
//. of type `Number` and returns a value of type `Number`.
//.
//. Some functions are parametrically polymorphic: their types are not fixed.
//. Type variables are used in the representations of such functions:
//.
//.     S.I :: a -> a
//.
//. `a` is a type variable. Type variables are not capitalized, so they
//. are differentiable from type identifiers (which are always capitalized).
//. By convention type variables have single-character names. The signature
//. above states that `S.I` takes a value of any type and returns a value of
//. the same type. Some signatures feature multiple type variables:
//.
//.     S.K :: a -> b -> a
//.
//. It must be possible to replace all occurrences of `a` with a concrete type.
//. The same applies for each other type variable. For the function above, the
//. types with which `a` and `b` are replaced may be different, but needn't be.
//.
//. Since all Sanctuary functions are curried (they accept their arguments
//. one at a time), a binary function is represented as a unary function that
//. returns a unary function: `* -> * -> *`. This aligns neatly with Haskell,
//. which uses curried functions exclusively. In JavaScript, though, we may
//. wish to represent the types of functions with arities less than or greater
//. than one. The general form is `(<input-types>) -> <output-type>`, where
//. `<input-types>` comprises zero or more comma–space (<code>, </code>)
//. -separated type representations:
//.
//.   - `() -> String`
//.   - `(a, b) -> a`
//.   - `(a, b, c) -> d`
//.
//. `Number -> Number` can thus be seen as shorthand for `(Number) -> Number`.
//.
//. Sanctuary embraces types. JavaScript doesn't support algebraic data types,
//. but these can be simulated by providing a group of data constructors that
//. return values with the same set of methods. A value of the Either type, for
//. example, is created via the Left constructor or the Right constructor.
//.
//. It's necessary to extend Haskell's notation to describe implicit arguments
//. to the *methods* provided by Sanctuary's types. In `x.map(y)`, for example,
//. the `map` method takes an implicit argument `x` in addition to the explicit
//. argument `y`. The type of the value upon which a method is invoked appears
//. at the beginning of the signature, separated from the arguments and return
//. value by a squiggly arrow (`~>`). The type of the `fantasy-land/map` method
//. of the Maybe type is written `Maybe a ~> (a -> b) -> Maybe b`. One could
//. read this as:
//.
//. _When the `fantasy-land/map` method is invoked on a value of type `Maybe a`
//. (for any type `a`) with an argument of type `a -> b` (for any type `b`),
//. it returns a value of type `Maybe b`._
//.
//. The squiggly arrow is also used when representing non-function properties.
//. `Maybe a ~> Boolean`, for example, represents a Boolean property of a value
//. of type `Maybe a`.
//.
//. Sanctuary supports type classes: constraints on type variables. Whereas
//. `a -> a` implicitly supports every type, `Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a ->
//. f b` requires that `f` be a type that satisfies the requirements of the
//. Functor type class. Type-class constraints appear at the beginning of a
//. type signature, separated from the rest of the signature by a fat arrow
//. (`=>`).
