//. Whereas Ramda has no dependencies, Sanctuary has a modular design:
//. [sanctuary-def][] provides type checking, [sanctuary-type-classes][]
//. provides Fantasy Land functions and type classes, [sanctuary-show][]
//. provides string representations, and algebraic data types are provided
//. by [sanctuary-either][], [sanctuary-maybe][], and [sanctuary-pair][].
//. Not only does this approach reduce the complexity of Sanctuary itself,
//. but it allows these components to be reused in other contexts.
