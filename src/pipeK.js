//# pipeK :: (Foldable f, Chain m) => f (Any -> m Any) -> m a -> m b
//.
//. Takes a sequence of functions assumed to be unary that return values
//. with a [Chain][], and a value of that Chain, and returns the result
//. of applying the sequence of transformations to the initial value.
//.
//. In general terms, `pipeK` performs left-to-right [Kleisli][] composition
//. of an sequence of functions. `pipeK ([f, g, h]) (x)` is equivalent to
//. `chain (h) (chain (g) (chain (f) (x)))`.
//.
//. ```javascript
//. > S.pipeK ([S.tail, S.tail, S.head]) (S.Just ([1, 2, 3, 4]))
//. Just (3)
//. ```
