//# gets :: (Any -> Boolean) -> Array String -> a -> Maybe b
//.
//. Takes a predicate, a property path (an array of property names), and
//. an object and returns Just the value at the given path if such a path
//. exists and the value satisfies the given predicate; Nothing otherwise.
//.
//. See also [`get`](#get).
//.
//. ```javascript
//. > S.gets (S.is ($.Number)) (['a', 'b', 'c']) ({a: {b: {c: 42}}})
//. Just (42)
//.
//. > S.gets (S.is ($.Number)) (['a', 'b', 'c']) ({a: {b: {c: '42'}}})
//. Nothing
//.
//. > S.gets (S.is ($.Number)) (['a', 'b', 'c']) ({})
//. Nothing
